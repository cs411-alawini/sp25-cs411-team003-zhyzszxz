The E-Commerce Sales Prediction and Inventory Optimization System aims to enhance sales forecasting and inventory management for online retailers. By leveraging historical sales data, customer behavior, and market trends, the system will predict future sales, helping businesses reduce stockouts, prevent overstocking, and optimize inventory turnover.
The project integrates data analytics and machine learning to analyze past transactions, seasonal demand, and external factors such as promotions and holidays. It will provide actionable insights for store owners, allowing them to adjust stock levels dynamically, set competitive pricing, and improve order fulfillment efficiency. The system will also incorporate visual dashboards for real-time monitoring, enabling businesses to make data-driven decisions to maximize revenue and minimize waste. 


Description of an application of your choice. State as clearly as possible what you want to do. What problem do you want to solve, etc.?


3. Description: The E-Commerce Sales Prediction and Inventory Optimization System is designed to help online retailers and businesses accurately forecast sales trends and manage inventory more efficiently. The system leverages historical sales data, customer purchasing behavior, and external factors (e.g., seasonality, promotions, and economic trends) to predict future demand for products.
Problem it solve:
  (1). Overstocking & Wasted Inventory: Many e-commerce businesses overestimate demand, leading to excessive stock levels, storage costs, and product obsolescence.
  (2). Stockouts & Lost Sales: Underestimating demand results in out-of-stock products, causing missed revenue opportunities and dissatisfied customers.
  (3). Inefficient Supply Chain Management: Businesses often struggle with optimizing supplier orders and logistics, leading to delays and increased costs.
  (4). Lack of Data-Driven Decision Making: Many retailers manually estimate demand, which is error-prone and inefficient.




4. What would be a good creative component that can improve the functionality of your application? To get a better sense of what a creative component is, these are technically challenging features that improve the user experience of your application. Some examples include interactive visualization (using several packages with some level or engineering), using several APIs to support some information presentation or using smart transformations to process data. Some examples that are NOT creative components include: software features that are completed with a few lines of code (e.g. adding a google maps iframe). Again, if you are unsure, discuss with your project TA.


To enhance the reliability and security of our E-Commerce Sales Prediction and Inventory Optimization System, we propose integrating a real-time anomaly detection module to identify fraudulent transactions and data inconsistencies. This system will monitor incoming sales and inventory data streams to detect unusual activities, such as sudden spikes in orders from a single account, abnormally high transaction volumes, or discrepancies in stock levels that indicate potential data entry errors. By leveraging unsupervised machine learning models such as Isolation Forest and DBSCAN, the system will analyze transaction patterns and flag outliers in real time. A dedicated alerting mechanism will notify administrators via email, SMS, or Slack when anomalies are detected, allowing for immediate action to prevent fraudulent activities or correct errors. This feature not only strengthens data integrity but also goes beyond traditional forecasting methods by adding an intelligent layer of security and operational oversight. The technical challenge lies in designing an efficient pipeline for real-time data processing, anomaly detection, and automated alert generation, making it a valuable and innovative addition to our system.


5. Usefulness. Explain as clearly as possible why your chosen application is useful. What are the basic functions of your web application? (What can users of this website do? Which simple and complex features are there?). Make sure to answer the following questions: Are there any similar websites/applications out there?  If so, what are they, and how is yours different?
The E-Commerce Sales Prediction and Inventory Optimization System is a valuable tool for online retailers, supply chain managers, and business owners looking to improve sales forecasting and inventory management. By leveraging historical sales data, machine learning, and data analytics, the system helps businesses reduce overstocking, which leads to lower storage costs and prevents product obsolescence. It also ensures that popular products remain available, preventing stockouts and reducing lost sales. Additionally, the system enhances supply chain efficiency by predicting demand and recommending optimal reorder levels, eliminating inefficiencies caused by manual estimation. With data-driven decision-making, businesses can rely on predictive analytics to streamline operations and maximize profits.
The system offers a range of basic and advanced features to provide a comprehensive inventory and sales forecasting solution. The basic functionalities include a user dashboard that displays real-time inventory levels, sales trends, and demand forecasts. Users can upload CSV files containing sales data for analysis, while the current stock monitoring feature tracks inventory levels, highlights low-stock products, and suggests optimal reorder points. Additionally, historical sales trends can be analyzed through interactive visualizations, enabling businesses to assess past performance based on products, categories, or seasonal trends.
Beyond these core functions, the system incorporates advanced AI-driven automation to enhance accuracy and efficiency. Using predictive sales forecasting, the system applies machine learning models to predict future demand trends based on historical sales, seasonality, and market influences. The automated inventory optimization feature suggests ideal stock levels to prevent both overstocking and shortages, reducing unnecessary costs. Additionally, competitor and market trend analysis is integrated, pulling data from external sources such as Google Trends, Amazon, and Shopify APIs to provide insights into demand spikes and competitive pricing strategies. The system also includes automated alerts and notifications, informing users when inventory is running low or when an upcoming surge in demand is anticipated. Businesses can also generate customizable reports and insights, offering detailed analyses on sales performance, customer behavior, and inventory status.
While other e-commerce inventory management systems exist, such as Zoho Inventory, Shopify Inventory Management, and Amazon Seller Central, they lack certain advanced features. For example, Zoho Inventory provides inventory tracking but does not incorporate predictive analytics. Shopify Inventory Management tracks stock levels but does not integrate AI-driven forecasting models. Amazon Seller Central provides analytics but does not offer automated inventory optimization for small businesses.
What makes this system different is its AI-powered sales forecasting, which predicts future sales with greater accuracy compared to traditional inventory tracking tools. Additionally, the automated inventory recommendations dynamically adjust reorder levels based on sales predictions, ensuring businesses always have the right amount of stock. Lastly, it is customizable and scalable, making it adaptable for both small businesses and large e-commerce platforms.


6. Realness. We want you to build a real application. So, make sure to locate real datasets. Describe your data sources (Where is the data from? In what format [csv, xls, txt,...], data size [cardinality and degree], what information does the data source capture?).  It would be hard to satisfy stage 2 requirements with one dataset. Thus, we strongly recommend identifying at least two different data sources for your project.To build a real and functional E-Commerce Sales Prediction and Inventory Optimization System, we will use multiple real-world datasets from reliable sources. These datasets will capture historical sales transactions, customer purchasing behavior, inventory levels, and external market factors. Below are the identified data sources:
One data source is from Kaggle, named E-Commerce Sales Dataset, which contains 25 columns and is in CSV format. This dataset primarily provides insights into the profitability of e-commerce sales across various channels, including platforms like Shiprocket. It includes order details, customer information, and sales metrics, making it useful for analyzing revenue trends and customer purchasing behavior.
Another data source is the UCI Machine Learning Repository - Online Retail Dataset, which consists of actual transaction records from a UK-based online retailer. This dataset contains over 500,000 rows of transactions in Excel (XLSX) format, capturing order timestamps, product details, customer country, and sales quantity. This source is valuable for analyzing seasonal sales trends, customer segmentation, and demand forecasting.




7. A detailed description of the functionality that your website offers. This is where you talk about what the website delivers. Talk about how a user would interact with the application (i.e., things that one could create, delete, update, or search for). Read the requirements for stage 4 to see what other functionalities you want to provide to the users. You should include:
  (1). A low-fidelity UI mockup: What do you imagine your final application’s interface might look like? A PowerPoint slide or a pencil sketch on a piece of paper works!

Our final application interface aims to make managing e-commerce sales and inventory super simple. There will be a  main dashboard where you can quickly see key info like current stock levels, upcoming sales predictions, and alerts for any unusual activity. Users can upload CSV or Excel files to update data to easily create, read, update, or delete product entries.  We also consider adding a search bar to assist customers to quickly locate their target information.  In brief, it will look like a report with a clean header at the top displays our logo and navigation tabs while a sidebar on the left provides quick links to key sections like Inventory Overview, Sales Trends, and Alerts. 


  (2). Project work distribution: Who will be responsible for each of the tasks or subtasks?
Explain how backend systems will be distributed across members. Be as specific as possible as this could be part of the final peer evaluation metrics.

Xingyu Zhu: Manages file uploads and data ingestion by ensuring CSV/Excel files are correctly parsed and stored in the database.
Shengxin Zhang: Handles advanced SQL work such as setting up transactions, writing stored procedures and triggers, and enforcing constraints to keep data consistent.
Zexi Huang: Develops the real-time anomaly detection module and alert system to monitor unusual activity for the report section. 
Yiheng Zhou: Work on external APIs for market data to ensure the smooth communication between the frontend and backend.
